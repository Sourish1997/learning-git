# learning-git

This repository contains reference material for the session on Git and GitHub conducted by ACM VIT Vellore Student Chapter on 
20/09/17. Open learning_git.psd in Photoshop and make the layers visible one by one in order to view the presentation slides. 
The list of commands demonstrated in the session along with the corresponding console log has been added to the Learning Git â€“ Commands.docx
document. To practice the commands, you can clone the repository, reset the HEAD to the very first commit and attempt to mimic 
the commits on remote.
